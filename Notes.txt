Some notes on GPS messages
Good ref https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html
   "most sensors emit only RMC, GSA, GSV, GLL, VTG, and (rarely) ZDA. 
    Newer ones conforming to NMEA 3.x may emit GBS"

Stuff only tested on ublox ZED-F9P rtk gps chip

Accuracy of position indicators:
FAA Mode (NMEA 2.3 and later) - stuff needed by FAA
    A = Autonomous mode - satellite system used in non-differentail mode in opisition fix
    C = Quectel querk "Caution"        
    D = Differential Mode - satellite used in differential mode in poisition fix
    E = Estimated (dead-reckoning) mode
    F = RTK Float mode (not as accurate as RTK Integer - approx 6" over 1/2 mile error?)
    M = Manual Input Mode
    N = Data Not Valid
    P = Precise (4.00 and later) - satellite used in precision mode (no deliberate degradation) and higher resolution code (P-code) used to compute fix
    R = RTK Integer mode
    S = Simulated Mode
    Q = Quectel Querk "Unsafe"        

Integer rtk and float RTK refer to the ambiguity in phase during an algorithm - integer means the phase is an integer multiple, which is more precise, and float means non-integer phase resolution.

Date and time in GPS is represented as number of weeks from the start of zero second of 6 January 1980, plus number of seconds into the week. 
        


To get most info for general tracking, several messages are aggregated in this library

RMC message has no height info, but has 
- time as hhmmss.ss
- FAA Mode
- groundspeed in knots
- magnetic variation (difference between axis North pole and magnetic North)

GGA message has
- time as hhmmss.ss
- position (lat, long), # f digits is model dependent
- GPS quality:
- # of satellites in use 00-12
- horizontal dilution of precision in meters
- antenna height above mean sea level for selected geoid in meters
- geoidal separation (differenc ebetween geoid and wGS-84 elliosoid)

GLL message has
- position
- time hhmmss.ss
- FAA Mode

VTG message has
- course over ground degrees true
- course over gound degrees magnetic
- speed over ground, knots
- speed over ground, km/hr
- FAA Mode


GSV - Satellites in view. Come in groups, has 
- # sats
- IDs of sats
- elevation, aizjmuth
- SNR in dB (00-99) of sats

GSA - GPS DOP and active satellites
- mode
- id of 12 satellites usedin fix
- PDOP, HDOP, VDOP
- system ID

Messages relative counts in a sample
* 760 GSV - satellites in view
* 155 GSA - GPS DOP and active satellites
*  40 GLL - geographic position, 
*  40 GGA - gps fix data: time, position, fix
*  40 VTG - track made good - ground speed, course heading, knots, km/hr
*  40 RMC - recommended min nav info
